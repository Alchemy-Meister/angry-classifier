``Another issue concerns boundaries among irony and other figurative devices, such as sarcasm, satire or humor. According to literature, boundaries in meaning between different types of irony are fuzzy [Gibbs and Colston, 2007], and this makes more suitable annotations where different types of irony are not distinguished, as the one adopted in Sentiâ€“TUT''\cite{bosco2013developing}.
