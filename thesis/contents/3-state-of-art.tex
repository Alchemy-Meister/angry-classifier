Differences between Sentiment and Emotion Analysis

SemEval works on sentiment analysis, which focuses on binary or multiclass classification, being Positive, Neutral and Negative the most common one.
This means:
 None of the SemEval preprocessed datasets are valid for me. (Raw data may work for manual annotation)
 The need of procedure adaptation to fit my research domain.
E.g. Use Emotion lexicon, such as EmoLex or LIWC, instead of  those related to Sentiment.
Need to focus the research on discover word features that help to classify anger in texts.
E.g. Heavy Punctuation, Quotation Marks, Emoticons; Unigrams, among others.
